       "'Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt was born in the city of Radauti near Czernowitz, in an area that was in Romania at the time and later became part of the Ukraine. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt was a Volksdeutsche, or ethnic German. At the beginning of the 1930s, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt worked as a building contractor in Czernowitz. Without revealing Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt identity, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt helped poor Jews in Czernowitz with food and money. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt also gave the Jewish workers that Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt employed money over and above the Jewish workers that he employed salaries, and provided the money for two of the Jewish workers that he employed to immigrate to Israel. In 1940 Czernowitz was annexed to the Soviet Union. As part of the arrangement with Germany the Volksdeutsche of the area were forced to move to areas belonging to Germany. In 1941 Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt moved to Zagłębie province in the western part of Poland (annexed to the Reich in 1939). The German authorities appointed Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt a trustee, assigning Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt a number of factories previously owned by Jews. In Będzin, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt made contact with the Zionist underground. In the beginning of 1943, when the Jews of the area were concentrated into ghettos, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt arranged with the Zionist underground that the shoe polish factory Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt managed, which was situated only a few meters away from the Będzin ghetto, would serve as a center for rescue operations. Members of the Zionist underground turned the attic of the shoe polish factory he managed, which was situated only a few meters away from the Będzin ghetto into a hiding place, and Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidtprivate office became a workshop for the production of forged documents and stamps. At the end of July 1943, the Germans surrounded the Będzin ghetto with the goal of destroying the Będzin ghetto. Some of the members of the Zionist underground managed to escape, and Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt hid Some of the members of the underground in the attic of this factory . Some 50 people hid in the attic of this factory for a period of four months. During hid , Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt supplied Some 50 people Some 50 people with food, which Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt bought on the black market. Some 50 people came out of hiding gradually as alternate hiding places were found for Some 50 people. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt sent each one of Some 50 people off with gifts of money, gold objects, food and clothing. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt operated in a similar fashion in Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt other factories in Zagłębie province in the western part of Poland (annexed to the Reich in 1939 . In early August 1943, when the Sosnowiec ghetto was liquidated, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt hid Jews who escaped from the Sosnowiec ghetto in Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt factory. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt used Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt contacts to find Jews who escaped from the ghetto in his factory alternate hiding places, and gave everyone who left money, food and clothing. In his factory , Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt hid Jews from every Aktion. During the final destruction of the Sosnowiec ghetto , Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, escaped to his factory, arriving during work hours. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt took Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, in, despite threats from some of Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt workers that some of his workers would report Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt to the authorities. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt denied that Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, was Jewish, and continued to hide Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, and other Jews. When the hiding place in his factory became too crowded, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt found work for Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, alongside Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt secretary in Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt factory in Będzin. Before Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, left for Będzin, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt gave Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, food and money, as well as a gold ring and chain that Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt took off. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt gave members of the underground the address of Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt sister, who lived in Vienna. Some of members of the underground arrived in Vienna , and his sister, who lived in Vienna house became a refuge. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt visited there occasionally and brought the Jewish fugitives clothing and money. After the war, Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt and Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt family continued to help in the struggle against the Nazis. As part of the effort to locate Adolf Eichmann, Fela Trajman, a member of the underground, was sent to the home of Adolf Eichmann disguised as a maid in order to gather information. Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt risked Pscheidt, Johann Johann Pscheidt life many times, both by cooperating with the underground , and by hiding fugitive Jews.
