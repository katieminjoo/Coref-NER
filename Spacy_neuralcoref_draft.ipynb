Polish friends managed to free her from the hands of the Gestapo after testifying that she was a legitimate Polish woman arrested by mistake. After her release, it was clear to her and those who freed her that she had to get out of Warsaw as quickly as possible. Her Polish friends summoned Jan Pikulski, a relative, to the city. He owned a farm in the village of Albinow, in the Opatow county, in the Kielce district. He took Dr. Rubillowicz into his home, ostensibly to help him with the farm chores, and Rubillowicz also cared for his paralyzed father. Pikulski also hid Irena Adwentowicz, Dr. Rubillowicz’s mother, Franciszka Szwarc, her grandmother, Stefania Dziewiecka and the wife of a Jewish doctor from a nearby town. The five Jewish women hid in Pikulski’s home for almost two years and he bore all the expenses of keeping them. Despite the rural idyll surrounding his home, there were those in the area who suspected that the five women were Jewish, but this did not deter Pikulski from continuing to hide them in his home. One morning, Germans surrounded the house. The women were arrested and taken to the nearest police station. Pikulski kept his wits about him and with the help of underground activists managed to arrange their release. Thanks to Pikulski’s kindness and courage, all five women survived until their liberation. After the war, Rubillowicz immigrated to Israel and the other survivors remained in Poland.

       "'Wörl, Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) spent 11 years of Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) life as a political prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) was first arrested by the Gestapo in 1934, and sent to Dachau for distributing a pamphlet in which the citizens of Munich were informed about the horrors of the camp. After spending some nine months in a dark detention cell, Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) was first transferred to the camp’s joinery and later, as a trained medical orderly, assigned to the camp’s sick-bay. In 1942, Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) was sent to Auschwitz together with 17 other male nurses to deal with an outbreak of typhus, which threatened not only the prisoners but also the German camp personnel. Appointed as the Lagerälteste (the camp elder) of the hospital barracks, Wörl, against the express orders of the SS, employed Jewish doctors, thus saving Jewish doctors from certain death. Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) also put Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) at risk in order to obtain at least a minimum of the required medicines and medical instruments for the treatment of the sick. Ludwig Ludwig Wörl (1906-1967) would forge selection lists in order to save Jewish patients from death by gassing. As a result of consistently countermanding the orders of the SS doctors aimed at decimating the number of the sick, Wörl was dismissed from Wörl post and incarcerated once again in an isolated detention cell. After a while Wörl was released and, by virtue of Wörl German descent and seniority, put in charge of Güntergrube, a forced-labor camp near Auschwitz. Here, again, Wörl made Wörl beneficial influence felt, protecting the 600 Jewish prisoners from maltreatment by sadistic German Kapos and seeing to it that the 600 Jewish prisoners get the 600 Jewish prisoners due share of food and clothing. Even prisoners with tuberculosis were able to survive because Wörl exempted Even prisoners with tuberculosis from hard work and protected Even prisoners with tuberculosis by various subterfuges from the inspection of the SS doctors. At the time of the evacuation of Auschwitz, Wörl helped prisoners escape from the infamous death marches. After the war Wörl, who became chairman of the Organization of Former Auschwitz Prisoners in Germany, dedicated Wörl life to perpetuating the memory of the Nazi crimes and bringing the Nazi crimes perpetrators to justice. In 1963, Wörl took the stand as one of the key witnesses in the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt am Main. On March 19, 1963, Yad Vashem recognized Ludwig Wörl as Righteous Among the Nations. '"
